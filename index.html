      <br>What happens when we design maps to reflect mood and desire rather than utility?<br>Can computational
      tools be playful, emotional, and ambiguous — not just rational?<br>How might this reflect, critique, or
      offer alternatives to normative technologies of urban navigation?<br><br>

      Sketchpad marked the birth of computational drawing and the graphic user
      interface, embedding ideas of precision, parametric logic, and user-agency into design software. It introduced the
      computer as a medium for modeling — for encoding geometry, constraints, and control. It laid the groundwork for
      CAD, and by extension, the entire logic of optimization that underpins modern computational design. My project
      emerges from this lineage but turns its assumptions sideways. Where Sketchpad prioritized constraint-solving,
      clarity, and structure, the Serendipity Map seeks ambiguity, subjectivity, and drift. Instead of modeling form, I am
      modeling feeling. This interface is not a precision instrument but a mood tuner.<br><br>

      I situate myself as a computational designer who believes maps are rhetorical objects — I am reimagining the
      routing algorithm as a playful, affective, and participatory medium. My audience includes designers, urbanists,
      and digital users frustrated with the flatness of conventional navigation tools. I want my tool to not be static,
      but dynamically changing based on the user. It is personalized and unique to each user.<br><br>

    <div class="section-content">Informed by CDP’s emphasis on design as critique, this project explores how
      computational logic can be turned sideways: toward mood, ambiguity, and experiential pluralism. The dérive becomes
      not just an aesthetic reference, but a computational protocol — replacing cost functions with curiosity, direction
      with drift.<br><br>

      Serendipity scoring (street segments as mood data) <br>

      Route computation with subjective tuning <br>

      Speculative UI prototyping <br><br>

      Approach: A hybrid of quantitative metrics and qualitative affective modeling <br><br>

      If Google Maps tells us how to get there fastest, this tool asks: what if you don’t know where you’re going, only
      how you want to feel on the way?<br><br>

      Potential for participatory layer: people annotate streets by emotion.<br><br>

      Conceptual: Translating psychogeographic theory into computational form without flattening it.<br><br>

      Visual: Balancing abstraction and readability in the output.<br><br>

      Personal Plan: Continue building Grasshopper logic, explore Mapbox interactivity, and collaborate with peers on
      data annotation layer. Data collection about cognitive distance vs real distance. Iterative prototyping of UI.<br><br>
